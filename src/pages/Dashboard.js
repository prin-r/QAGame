            Band Protocol is a protocol for decentralized data governance on the
            Ethereum blockchain. Using various token economics, the protocol
            incentivizes multiple independent parties to work cooperatively to
            provide trusted data. Curated information is available on-chain,
            ready to be consumed by other blockchain protocols or decentralized
            applications. Band Protocol serves as the data layer of the Web3
            ecosystem, bridging real world and/or subjective information to the
            smart contract world.
